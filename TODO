TODO
----

* files table needs a "last submitted for processing" column

* need a lambda to periodically check the user list for updates - invoke processUserList

* what's the accepted style for programming Node with all these callbacks?

* Add an inside side of processUser.

* Add an inside lambda which updates the time that a file was processed at. Maybe this just needs to be a library function.

* create a system health dashboard

* inside-vpc -> inside, outside-vpc -> downloader, client stack?
* API should be in the inside stack.

TESTING
-------


DONE
----

* In outside, get the fireFileProcessing lambda to successfully invoke toProcess, parse the JSON, and fire off some
other outside lambdas.
* Add an outside lambda which reads from the toProcess list and fires processUser lambdas.
* can I wrap the https access stuff in a method?
* what needs to be in the API? What can be invoked directly by lambda? - only things needed by clients need to be in the API.
