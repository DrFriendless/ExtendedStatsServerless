DONE
----

* In outside, get the fireFileProcessing lambda to successfully invoke toProcess, parse the JSON, and fire off some
other outside lambdas.
* Add an outside lambda which reads from the toProcess list and fires processUser lambdas.
* can I wrap the https access stuff in a method?
* what needs to be in the API? What can be invoked directly by lambda? - only things needed by clients need to be in the API.
* inside-vpc -> inside, outside-vpc -> downloader, client stack?
* files table needs a "last submitted for processing" column
* API should be in the inside stack.
* create a system health dashboard
* need a lambda to periodically check the user list for updates - invoke processUserList
* Add an inside side of processUser.
* Add an inside lambda which updates the time that a file was processed at. Maybe this just needs to be a library function.
* what's the accepted style for programming Node with all these callbacks?
