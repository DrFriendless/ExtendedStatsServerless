TODO
----

* In outside, get the fireFileProcessing lambda to successfully invoke toProcess, parse the JSON, and fire off some
other outside lambdas.

* Add an outside lambda which reads from the toProcess list and fires processUser lambdas.

* Add an inside lambda which updates the time that a file was processed at. Maybe this just needs to be a library function.

* give the inside and outside APIs different root paths

* create a system health dashboard

TESTING
-------

* can I wrap the https access stuff in a method?
