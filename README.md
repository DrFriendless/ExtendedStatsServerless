# ExtendedStatsServerless
Extended Stats using the Serverless framework.

This is a rewrite of Extended Stats in the cloud, using:

 * Serverless framework
 * AWS Lambda, RDS, API Gateway, CloudWatch, CloudFormation, S3, Route 53, and Certificate Manager
 * UI components in Angular 6
 * Lambdas written in Node.js.

It's still early days, but what there is to be seen can be seen at http://extstats.drfriendless.com.
