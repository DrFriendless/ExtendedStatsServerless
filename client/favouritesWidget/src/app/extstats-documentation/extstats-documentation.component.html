    <ngb-tab title="Friendless Happiness Metric">
      <ng-template ngbTabContent>
        <p>This metric attempts to assess how much you love this game. It's RATING * 5 + PLAYS + MONTHS PLAYED IN * 4 + HOURS PLAYED.</p>
      </ng-template>
    </ngb-tab>
    <ngb-tab title="Huber Happiness Metric">
      <ng-template ngbTabContent>
        <p>This metric also attempts to assess how much you love this game. It's (RATING - 4.5) * HOURS PLAYED. </p>
      </ng-template>
    </ngb-tab>
    <ngb-tab title="Huber Heat">
      <ng-template ngbTabContent>
        <p>The Huber Heat metric attempts to assess how much you love this game right now. It's complicated.
          Let S be 1 + (PLAYS IN THE LAST YEAR) / (PLAYS EVER).
          Let LAST YEAR HAPPINESS be (RATING - 4.5) * HOURS PLAYED IN THE LAST YEAR.
          Then the Huber Heat is S^2 * sqrt(PLAYS IN THE LAST YEAR) * LAST YEAR HAPPINESS.

    <ngb-tab title="Randy Cox Not Unhappiness Metric">
      <ng-template ngbTabContent>
        <p>The Randy Cox Not Unhappiness Metric attempts to assess not how much you love this game, but how much you don't hate it.
          Let FL be (days between your first and last plays of it) divided by (days since you last played it).
          Let FLMR be FL times the number of months you've played it in times your rating.
          Then if that's less than 1, R!UHM is zero (which penalises games you've played recently), otherwise it's log(FLMR).
          So R!UHM is high for games you've been playing for a long time and still rate highly.
