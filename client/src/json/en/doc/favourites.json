Let FL be (days between your first and last plays of it) divided by (days since you last played it). Let FLMR be FL times the number of months you've played it in times your rating. Then if that's less than 1, R!UHM is zero (which penalises games you've played recently), otherwise it's log(FLMR). So R!UHM is high for games you've been playing for a long time and still rate highly."]
