    <h2>Selectors Documentation</h2>

    <P>Selectors are the rules used to choose which games to show in a particular view.
      Selectors are used by you to choose what games you see stats about.
      They're just text, and look a bit like a computer program, e.g. <i>all(owned("Friendless"), played(ME))</i>.
    </P>
    <ul>
      <li><i>owned("Friendless")</i> means "games owned by Friendless".</li>
      <li><i>played(ME)</i> means "games played by me".</li>
      <li><i>all(some selectors)</i> means "games which are selected by all of these selectors".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So <i>all(owned("Friendless"), played(ME))</i> means "games owned by Friendless which I have played".
    </p>
    <P>
      But who's ME?
      ME is a special symbol which means "the person whose page this is".
      You can tell it's special because it's all in capitals and doesn't have quotes around it.
      So when anyone uses that selector, it means "games owned by Friendless which they have played."
      That allows selectors to be written so that they can be easily shared amongst users.
    </P>
    <p>
      And that's pretty much all there is to selectors.
      The devil is in the detail of all the functions, so the rest of this documentation will just be a list of what those mean.
      To try things out, you can fill in details in the form above and click TEST, and the results will appear in the table below.
      So that you can see the form and the results at the same time, click the "Hide Doc" button to hide this text.
      If it's not working, you can open the JavaScript console to see some debugging information.
    </p>
    <h3>Special Symbols</h3>
    <p>Special symbols are fully capitalised words.
      Usually their meaning is defined by the page you're on, but I'll try to keep those meanings consistent so that selectors are portable across pages.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>ME</dt><dd>The geek who this page is about.</dd>
      <dt>THEM</dt><dd>Some other geek who is being compared to ME.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>
      Note that when a function applies to a geek, the geek may be ME or THEM or any BGG username in quotes, e.g. "Aldie",
      as long as that user is in Extended Stats.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>all(A, B...)</dt><dd>Games which are in all of the listed selections.</dd>
      <dt>any(A, B...)</dt><dd>Games which are in any of the listed selections.</dd>
      <dt>books()</dt><dd>All games in the category "Book".</dd>
      <dt>category(name)</dt><dd>All games in the named category.</dd>

      <dt>expansions()</dt><dd>All games which are expansions of some other game.</dd>
      <dt>mechanic(name)</dt><dd>All games which have the named mechanic.</dd>
      <dt>minus(A, B...)</dt><dd>Games which are in selection A but not in any of the other selections.</dd>
      <dt>owned(geek)</dt><dd>Games owned by that geek. Sets the 'owner' metadata.</dd>
      <dt>played(geek)</dt><dd>Games ever played by that geek. Sets the 'player' metadata.</dd>
      <dt>publisher(number)</dt><dd>All games published by the publisher, denoted by their number on BGG.</dd>
      <dt>rated(geek)</dt><dd>Games rated by that geek. Sets the 'rater' metadata.</dd>
      <dt>colour("red", A)</dt><dd>When the games in A come back, colour them red. I think you can use any valid HTML colour string. Technically this sets the 'colour' metadata. Yes, it's Australian spelling.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Metadata</h3>
    <p>
      When a selector returns a game, it includes with it some metadata about the selection.
      This can be used to tell you why the game got selected.
      For example, if you want to find all of the games owned by you or played by Aldie, you can write a selector to do that.
      But then when the games come back, you might not be sure which it is.
      If you look in the metadata though, either 'owner' will be set to you, or 'player' will be set to Aldie, or both.
      And that's why the game is in the selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      A further trick with metadata is that it can include a colour.
      I haven't started using the colour in the main site yet, but I'll get there.
      When you call the function 'colour' on a selection, the 'colour' metadata for all of those games is set to that colour.
      And then in the selection result table, it's coloured that way.
      Note that a game might be assigned two colours for different reasons, and it can only have one, which I will try to make sure is the last colour assigned during evaluation of the selector.
